# SafeScreen-Supplymentary

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper "SafeScreen: Facial Video De-identification for Privacy-Preserving Stroke Screening."

We provide four generated videos: Two for stroke patients (Stroke_1 and Stroke_2). Two for non-stroke patients (Non_Stroke_1 and Non_Stroke_2).

Due to the large video size, it is hard to view them online. Please download the videos to view them. To protect the patient's privacy, we don't show the driving videos, which are videos of real patients.
